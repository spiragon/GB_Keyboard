Attempt 2 in the Better Word Input Project

Keyboards are not a natural way of communicating, but they have been integral to the way we turn thoughts into words since the days of the typewriter. This was tolerable while keyboards were big and tactile. However with on-screen keyboards on small screens, typing is difficult again. This project aims to get information "in" faster and with less effort on the part of the user. 

Stay tuned for updates
